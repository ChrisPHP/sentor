# signal_when: optional, can be either 'not published' or 'published'. Respectively, it will send a warning when the topic is not published or when it is.
# signal_lambdas: optional, it's a list of (pythonic) lambda expressions such that when they are satisfied a warning is sent. You can use the python package `math` in your lambda expressions.
# execute: optional, a list of (sentor) actions to execute when a warning is sent.
# lock_exec: optional (default=False), lock out other threads while this one is executing its sequence of actions.
# timeout: optional (default=0), amount of time (in seconds) for which the signal has to be satisfied before sending the warning.

# Child arguments of `execute`:
# call: optional, call a rosservice.
# publish: optional, publish to a rostopic.
# action: optional, send a goal for an actionlib action.
# sleep: optional, put the sentor node to sleep.
# shell: optional, execute a shell command.  

# Child arguments of `call`:
# user_msg: optional, publish your own (string) message to the topic `/sentor/event` when `call` is executed. 
# service_name: the name of the service you are calling.
# service_args: a list of service arguments specified in the service request class. Each arg must be prefixed by `req.`.

# Child arguments of `publish`:
# user_msg: optional, publish your own (string) message to the topic `/sentor/event` when `publish` is executed.
# topic_name: the name of the topic you are publishing to. 
# topic_latched: boolean specifying whether you are latching the topic (or not).
# topic_args: a list of topic arguments specified in the topic's message class. Each arg must be prefixed by `msg.`.

# Child arguments of `action`:
# user_msg: optional, publish your own (string) message to the topic `/sentor/event` when `action` is executed.
# namespace: the namespace of the action.
# package: the ros package from the which the action specification is retrieved. The action spec is retrieved from `package.msg`. 
# action_spec: the action specification.
# goal_args: a list of goal arguments specified in the action spec's goal class. Each arg must be prefixed by `goal.`.

# Child arguments of `sleep`:
# user_msg: optional, publish your own (string) message to the topic `/sentor/event` when `sleep` is executed.
# duration: sleep the sentor node for `duration` seconds.

# Child arguments of `shell`:
# user_msg: optional, publish your own (string) message to the topic `/sentor/event` when `shell` is executed.
# cmd_args: a list of shell command components separated by spaces at the command line.
